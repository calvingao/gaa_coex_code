# gaa_coex_code
This is a backup for the source code of the GAA-GAA Coexistence Simulation
The project was written python 2.7. We are currently working on Python3 version for any future update
The key classes are included in the .py files begins with gaa_
The geographic and propagation related code and database are not included. (Dummy code in folder /propagation_models/geo and /propagation_models/propagation)
The detail implementation of geographic and propagation can be find in https://github.com/Wireless-Innovation-Forum/Spectrum-Access-System
Some scripts (e.g. those begin with app3_) are just the scenarios used or tested in our previous simulation projects.
